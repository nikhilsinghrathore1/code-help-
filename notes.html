<!-- okay so this project i need to first make the basic structure withe the html and css and then i have to add the javascript but i think the css part will also be hard so let's hope that i am able to finish it today otherwise i have to finish it tomorrow cause i have to finish it anyways 

okay so let's start with making the first discount bar on the top 

okay so the work is finally done on the discount section it took unexpectedly long but okay i am happy with the result so now let's move forward with the nav bar section

okay so the nav bar section is also completed now i have to make the this main section but i should have started with the creating a page section and then giving it height and width but i didn't and now i think it will fuck the entire page so lets not do it here for the next page i will make it but first i have to finish this page so let's do it  fuck i wish that  this page gets completed before 4:30 if that happens then i am good

okay so the easy part took me about an hour to make now the hard part still remains i hope that i am able to finish it before the 4:30 mark well i have about one hour to make that and then i don't know how but the positioning of the top navbar has changed so i have to fix it as well so but first i am going to make the img section then only i will fix the postioining of the navbar or maybe in the last after all this is done before javascript so let's begin

okay so till now i have completed the increasing number section and currently working on the css grid section and i think i will be completed soon i am just waiting for the internet to come back after that i think i will be able to finish the grid section in just 30 minutes and then we'll move onto the next section i am hoping that i will be able to complete this website by tomorrow's midnight and then after it will take only one day to apply the javascript and the gsap and scroll trigger and maybe locomotive so i think this will be completed this week

so the structuring and the disigning of the website is done now i just have to add the javascript to make it functional and then it's complete i think i should be complete by tomorrow and then i'll upload it to the github so that i become familier with github-->
